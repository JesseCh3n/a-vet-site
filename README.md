# A Vet Site

## Description

<p>In the final bootcamp project I decided to build a website for a vet clinic, which includes an interactive booking system.</p>
<p>The idea came to mind when my girlfriend, who's a vet, vent her frustrations one day when her schedule was very disorganised.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to build a new website for her clinic, based on modern web framework and technologies.

* <b>Designer</b> Jesse Chen

Along the way I have encountered a few challenges in achieving my goals. Some of the challenges are as follows:

* No prior knowledge of REACT framework and GraphQL data query language.
* There is a substantial amount of documentation to refer when working with 3rd party packages like MongoDB, Apollo server and Vite.
* I have encountered a few issues because of typos in GraphQL schemas, which are not highlighted in VS Code.
* I had some difficulties in deploying the application on Heroku.
